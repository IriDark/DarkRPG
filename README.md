# DarkRPG — Development
DarkRPG — A big RPG themed project that adds some mobs, bosses, blocks, weapons, and some bunch of content in "vanilla" texture style

The world was pierced by darkness, 4 elements were divided and warring, can you stop evil and reunite the elements by restoring balance to the world? Darkness left its mark on the world for many centuries many monsters were born seemingly in the very peaceful places.
